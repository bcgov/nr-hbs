# Virus scanning (ClamAV)

Every uploaded file — today the scale-data XML submitted on "Submit File of
Detail Returns" (legacy P505, which never scanned) — is virus-scanned before it
is validated or stored. Scanning is done by a shared
**ClamAV `clamd`** daemon spoken over **raw TCP** using the native `INSTREAM`
socket protocol (port `3310`). It is **not** HTTP — ClamAV has no HTTP API.

## Where it runs in the pipeline

The scan happens on the raw bytes, up front, before any parsing:

```
upload ──▶ VIRUS SCAN ──▶ XSD validate ──▶ transmission record ──▶ store for intake
           (clamd INSTREAM)
```

| Upload | Scanned in | On rejection |
|--------|-----------|--------------|
| Scale-data XML (P505) | `submission/SubmissionService.submit` (`scanOrThrow`) | `VirusDetectedException` → `422` |

Two rejection codes surface (both `422`), shown as the error on the
submission page (`SubmitScaleDataPage.tsx`):

| Code | Meaning | UI label |
|------|---------|----------|
| `VIRUS_DETECTED` | clamd reported a signature match | "Virus detected" |
| `VIRUS_SCAN_UNAVAILABLE` | scanner unreachable/errored under a fail-closed policy | "Virus scan unavailable" |

## Fail-open vs fail-closed

When the scanner can't be reached (or errors), the `hbs.clamav.fail-open`
policy decides what happens:

- **fail-closed** (`false`, the default) — reject the upload
  (`VIRUS_SCAN_UNAVAILABLE`). Secure: no upload is ever stored unscanned.
- **fail-open** (`true`) — allow the upload through. Used where a reliable
  clamd isn't available (local dev; ephemeral PR previews that can't reach the
  shared clamd).

An **infected** verdict is always rejected regardless of this policy.

## Configuration

All via env (defaults in `application.properties`):

| Env var | Default | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `CLAMAV_ENABLED` | `true` | Master switch. `false` = skip scanning entirely (no-op). |
| `CLAMAV_HOST` | — (**required**) | clamd host, e.g. `clamav.<tools-namespace>.svc.cluster.local`. No default — the deploy fails unless it's set (GitHub **secret** `CLAMAV_HOST` per environment, threaded through `reusable-deploy.yml`). |
| `CLAMAV_PORT` | `3310` | clamd TCP port. |
| `CLAMAV_FAIL_OPEN` | `false` | See above. `true` tolerates a scanner outage. |
| `CLAMAV_CONNECT_TIMEOUT` | `5s` | Socket connect timeout. |
| `CLAMAV_READ_TIMEOUT` | `30s` | Reply read timeout. |

### Startup health check

On boot the backend sends a `PING` to clamd and logs the result (`INFO` when it
replies `PONG`, `WARN` otherwise) so a misconfigured/unreachable scanner is
visible immediately in the logs rather than only on the first upload.

### Per-scan logging

Every scan emits one greppable verdict line carrying the filename and size:

```
clamav scan: 'my-submission.xml' (9581760 bytes) → CLEAN          # INFO
clamav scan: 'evil.pdf' (2048 bytes) → INFECTED (Eicar-Test-Signature) — rejecting   # WARN
clamav scan: 'doc.pdf' (1024 bytes) → UNAVAILABLE (connection refused) — failing CLOSED, rejecting   # WARN
```

## Deployment — reaching clamd across namespaces

> ⚠️ **Required manual step:** a `NetworkPolicy` must exist **inside the ClamAV
> (tools) namespace** to let this app's backend reach clamd. The deploy pipeline
> does **not** create it — you (or whoever owns the tools namespace) must apply

clamd runs in the shared **tools** namespace, not the app namespace. Reaching it
cross-namespace can be blocked on **either side**, so there are two policies:

**1. Ingress on clamd (tools namespace) — created MANUALLY.** The clamd pod only
accepts traffic an ingress `NetworkPolicy` in the tools namespace allows. This
rule must let the app namespace open TCP 3310 to the clamd pods (e.g.
`podSelector: app.kubernetes.io/name=clamav` — the standard ClamAV Helm chart's
pod label; one `allow-<app-ns>-to-clamav` policy per environment). **The deploy
pipeline does not create this** — the tools namespace is managed out of band, so
apply this policy by hand (or via whatever manages the tools namespace). A
starting-point manifest:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-<app-namespace>-to-clamav
  namespace: <tools-namespace>
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app.kubernetes.io/name: clamav
  ingress:
    - from:
        - namespaceSelector:
            matchLabels:
              kubernetes.io/metadata.name: <app-namespace>
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 3310
  policyTypes:
    - Ingress
```

**2. Egress from the backend (app namespace) — always applied.** The backend
`openshift.deploy.yml` includes an egress `NetworkPolicy`
(`${NAME}-backend-${ZONE}-egress`) that permits **all** egress from the backend
pods. It ships with every backend deploy — no flag, no separate step. It's
permit-all rather than a narrow `DNS + clamd` allow-list because NetworkPolicy
egress is all-or-nothing per pod: the backend also needs Oracle, Keycloak,
user-lookup, and SMTP, so a narrow policy would silently break those wherever
the namespace baseline doesn't already default-deny egress. Permit-all can't
reduce access below the current open baseline and guarantees the app side never
blocks clamd.

> **Diagnosing "can't connect to clamd":** the egress side (#2) is handled
> automatically, so a failure almost always means the tools **ingress** (#1) —
> confirm the manual `allow-<app-ns>-to-clamav` policy was applied into clamd's
> namespace and that its `podSelector` matches the real clamd pod labels
> (`oc -n <tools-ns> get pods --show-labels`). Note clamd must be in a namespace
> your app namespace is allowed to reach — cross-license-plate connections are
> generally blocked.

### Required GitHub Actions secrets

Set these per GitHub Environment (`dev`, `test`, later `prod`), threaded through
`pr-open.yml` / `merge.yml` → `reusable-deploy.yml`:

| Secret | Value |
|--------|-------|
| `CLAMAV_HOST` | clamd host — **required** for the backend deploy (the template has no default) |

The pipeline no longer touches the tools namespace, so no tools-scoped token or
`OC_NAMESPACE_TOOLS` / `OC_TOKEN_TOOLS` secrets are needed — the clamd ingress
policy (#1 above) is applied manually.

## Local development

There is no clamd locally. Rather than run one, the `local` profile keeps the
scan path wired but **fails open** so offline uploads still work:

```properties
# application-local.properties
hbs.clamav.enabled=true
hbs.clamav.fail-open=true
```

Set `hbs.clamav.enabled=false` instead if you'd rather skip scanning outright.
Without one of these, every local upload is rejected with "Virus scan
unavailable" (the fail-closed default with no reachable clamd). 

## Code map

| Concern | Code |
|---------|------|
| Policy layer (enable / fail-open, rejection codes, startup PING, logging) | `service/v1/VirusScanner` |
| Low-level clamd client (INSTREAM framing, `scan`, `ping`) | `client/ClamAvClient` |
| Scan result value | `client/ScanResult` |
| Throw-style rejection → `422` | `exception/VirusDetectedException` (+ `RestExceptionHandler`) |
| UI | `frontend/src/pages/SubmitScaleDataPage.tsx` |
| Backend egress NetworkPolicy | `backend/openshift.deploy.yml` (`${NAME}-backend-${ZONE}-egress`) |
| Clamd ingress NetworkPolicy (tools ns) | applied manually — see "Deployment" above |
