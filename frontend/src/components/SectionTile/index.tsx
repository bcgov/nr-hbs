/**
 * A titled panel with its actions on the same line as the heading.
 *
 * Ported from nr-fam (which took it from nr-fsp-new's information tiles), so
 * the sibling applications lay a detail pane out the same way: a flat bordered
 * card, an icon beside a regular-weight title, and the section's buttons
 * sitting level with that title rather than stacked above the content.
 *
 * The buttons being level with the title is the point. Right-aligned above the
 * table they read as belonging to the tab; on the header line they read as
 * belonging to the thing the heading names.
